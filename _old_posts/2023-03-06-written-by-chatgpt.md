To highlight the power of the digital age, the EICs thought it would be interesting to include an essay created by a newly released AI chatbox, ChatGPT, that has taken the internet by storm. ChatGPT was released to the public this November, and gained over 1 million users in just five days. Below, we have included an essay produced by this language model including the prompt we used. We put ChatGPT’s artificial consciousness to the test, asking it to write an article about itself.

*The EICs asked the software to: “Write an article about ChatGPT” (generated in 32 seconds)*

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to understand and generate human-like text in a conversational context.

ChatGPT is based on the GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3) architecture, which uses a deep learning technique called transformer-based language model to generate text. This allows ChatGPT to generate coherent and fluent responses to user inputs, making it ideal for use in chatbots and other conversational applications.

One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to maintain context in a conversation. This means that ChatGPT can generate responses that are relevant to the previous conversation, allowing for more natural and engaging interactions with users. For example, if a user asks ChatGPT a question, it can generate a response that directly answers the question, rather than just providing a generic response.

Another key advantage of ChatGPT is its large-scale training data. Unlike many other NLP models, which are trained on a limited amount of data, ChatGPT was trained on a massive dataset of over 10 trillion words, giving it a vast knowledge base to draw from. This allows ChatGPT to generate responses that are more accurate and knowledgeable than those generated by other models.

In addition to its conversational capabilities, ChatGPT also has the ability to perform a wide range of language tasks, including text summarization, translation, and sentiment analysis. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation services.

Overall, ChatGPT is a powerful and versatile NLP model that is capable of generating human-like text in a conversational context. Its ability to maintain context and draw from a vast knowledge base make it a valuable tool for applications that require natural language processing capabilities.

*EIC Conclusion*

Is it plausible that a human could have written what you just read? As you can now most likely attest to, the line between writer and robot is becoming increasingly blurred, making human detectability more difficult than ever. While there are countless benefits to this technology, many of which relate to task efficiency, such advanced AI poses several dangers for the future. The world has been quick to celebrate the success of chatGPT, but its capabilities for spreading misinformation, hidden bias, lack of morals, malware, and implications for the workforce, are still unknown. ChatGPT is designed to be more convincing than necessarily accurate. Therefore, as exciting and realistic as its responses may be, it is important to take them with a grain of salt.
