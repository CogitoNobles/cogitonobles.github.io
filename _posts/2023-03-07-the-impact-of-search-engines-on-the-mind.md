“Hold on, let me Google that.”

*What year was the Constitution of the United States signed?*

*Who first said “time is money”?*

*How do you give a Heimlich Maneuver?*

What used to be common knowledge has now devolved into common Google searches. What used to be ingrained in our minds is now only available to us through the screens of our devices. Memory has turned into rubble. 

Despite this, technology in general isn't “bad,” and has proved to be practically invaluable when it comes to helpful tools and social outlets. On the flip side, accessible know-all search engines have made us lazier, and that, in turn, has weakened our abilities to motivate ourselves to work, remember important information, and put in the effort to make our dreams come true.

In 2011, about 35% of people in the United States reported addiction to their cell phones – which is understandable, as at the time the phone's budding addictive properties could not overcome its blocky, monolith-shaped design; however, with the evolution of the device’s versatility, hardware, and specs, those stats have spiked to 81% of Americans. The rise of the digital age has also given birth to a number of fears and conditions. Nomophobia, for example, is the fear of not having your phone with you wherever you go. There also exists a condition called “phantom vibrations”, where you may feel as though your phone is ringing or vibrating (although it isn’t), prompting you to steal a glance at your screen.

And most of the time, one look will take a while.

These addictions are making it easier for people to rely on their phones in order to answer anything that they would have otherwise learned, and that’s the cause of countless repercussions, ranging from long-term negative cerebral effects to heavy impacts on our everyday lives.

*Google Translate the word pencil to Spanish*

*George Washington has wooden teeth true or false*

*Solve (253 + 23)y - 4 / 42 = 8y + 46*

Different topics have different impacts on our brains – learning languages, for example, enhances your ability to problem-solve, while memorizing facts (from history or otherwise) strengthens your brain and promotes better retrieval of information. According to research done by the University of Oxford, students without math practice or skills have less cognitive development than their peers, while those who actively study mathematics are stronger in that department. The usage of phones in lieu of those classes produces a dastardly effect: the reduction of one’s ability to think, remember, and move on. And from then on, things can only get worse.

As time goes by, with less and less to remember, searches get more and more common.

*What color is opposite orange*

*Who was the first president*

Search history has turned into thought process, and then to dust.
 
*Slope formula*

*Lake saltwater or freshwater*

This goes on until the person becomes utterly dependent and sustained by their search engine, to the extent that it becomes the voice inside their head, replacing common sense.

*Can you get hurt by crashing your bike*

Soon they can no longer trust themselves to think properly without consulting their phones to see if they’re right.

*4 times 8*

*Words that rhyme with ruin*

Memory becomes only a fragment of what it used to be.

“What’s a synonym for addiction?”

It needs to be stopped –

“Hold on, let me Google that.”
