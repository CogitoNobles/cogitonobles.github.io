Today, an additional 2.5 quintillion bytes of data were created, adding to the already colossal, 44-94 zettabytes of data (one zettabyte is equivalent to one billion terabytes). This data has immense importance for nations throughout the world in gaining an advantage over their adversaries. As a result, the efficient collection and processing of data are vital in order to maximize its benefits. However, despite being a seemingly benign idea, the methods of acquiring and utilizing this data often end up nefarious.

Citizens generate large amounts of data that can be utilized for a vast array of tasks. However, the acquisition of this data by governments is often impeded by various legal barriers. In order to circumvent these restrictions, governments run extralegal operations without the knowledge or consent of the public, an action some would consider to be authoritarian. However, democracies throughout the world, such as the US, partake in similar behaviors. This is despite laws to the contrary, which prohibit unreasonable and unwarranted searches of one’s possessions (including one’s data). For instance, through two sister projects, Projects Minaret and Shamrock, the National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted all domestic data and data that entered or exited the US that contained the name of any US citizen on a watchlist. The guidelines for creating these watchlists have never been released to the public and were created solely by the executive branch. There was no judicial oversight for either Minaret or Shamrock, and no warrants were obtained for the surveillance. Similarly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) ran the COINTELPRO (Counterintelligence Program) from 1956-1971, with the sole purpose of nullifying organizations deemed a threat to US political stability. The illegal acquisition of citizens’ data by their government isn’t limited to the US. The British intelligence and security agency, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), secretly gained access to the fiber optic cables that connect the globe. This allowed them to gain access to phone calls and internet traffic throughout the world, which was then shared with the NSA. The collected data was then filtered and examined in an operation named Tempora. The UK government didn’t solely collect data, rather, it also processed and analyzed this data. In fact, the non-governmental organization Amnesty International filed a court case against the UK government for their unsanctioned accessing of citizen data during the Tempora operation. According to Amnesty International, the UK secret services monitor 10 gigabytes of data per second that is being transferred through the bugged fiber optic cables. However, illegal actions aren’t solely limited to the data collection process. Nations often exploit the data they collect for further illegitimate programs.

Nations often cover up or completely deny the processing and analysis of illegally acquired citizens’ data. For example, since 2015, Moscow’s Department of Information Technologies (DIT) has been buying data from mobile operators. According to Deputy Moscow Mayor, Maxim Liksutov, the data is merely used for geoanalytics and has been depersonalized. However, research done by a joint US and Belgian team showed that even if the data was being used solely for geoanalytics, it was still sufficient to accurately discern 95% of the population. Likewise, the Chinese government has implemented automated systems amongst minority groups in order to stifle resistance and maintain the communist party’s tight grip over the population. These systems have been utilized in the Xinjiang province against the Uighurs, where they use around 60 variables to determine whether someone requires “reeducation”. While the internet provides a host of benefits, the exploitation of user data poses a significant threat to the privacy, freedom, and other unalienable rights of citizens throughout the world. It is important to understand how nations exploit their citizens’ data and ensure that citizens’ data is protected.
